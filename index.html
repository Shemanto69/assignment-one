            <h1>Soup</h1>Tom yam (pronounced ‘tom jam’) is a clear soup with an intensely sour and spicy flavour. It is
            made by combining lemongrass, lime leaves and galangal. A portion of meat or fish can also be added, while
            mushrooms are also a popular choice. All of this is flavoured with fish sauce, lime juice and chilli
            peppers. </p>

            <h1>American Breakfast</h1>LBreakfast is the first meal of the day eaten after waking from the night's
            sleep, usually in the morning.[1] The word in English refers to breaking the fasting period of the previous
            night.[2] There is a strong likelihood for one or more "typical", or "traditional", breakfast menus to exist
            in most places, but their composition varies widely from place to place, and has varied over time, so that
            globally a very wide range of preparations and ingredients are now associated with breakfast.</p>

            <h1>Steak</h1>A steak is a meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, potentially including a bone. It
            is normally grilled,[1] though can also be pan-fried. It is often grilled in an attempt to replicate the
            flavor of steak cooked over the glowing coals of an open fire.[1] Steak can also be cooked in sauce, such as
            in steak and kidney pie, or minced and formed into patties, such as hamburgers.</p>
